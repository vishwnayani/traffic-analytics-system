# 🚦 Traffic Analytics System

## Overview

An end-to-end Traffic Analytics System built using **YOLOv8l**, **ByteTrack**, **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and **Docker** for intelligent traffic monitoring and analysis.

The system automatically detects, tracks, and analyzes vehicles from traffic surveillance videos and generates actionable traffic insights including vehicle counts, speed estimation, lane utilization, traffic flow direction, congestion monitoring, and vehicle type distribution.
